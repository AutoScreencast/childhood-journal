We are at Ueshima No. 11 before going to Tokyo Medical & Surgical Center for my Six to Seven Months Old Health Checkup.

Dr. Tom Lomax examined me. My weight is 8,850 grams, and my height is 73.3 cm. Iâ€™m very tall for my age â€“ Iâ€™m at the 98th percentile. My head circumference is 44.8 cm. I have no health issues.
