Nine weeks old today!

Today I had my first vaccinations at Aiiku Clinic. I was injected three times, and given one oral dose. The injections were in my upper arms, and they hurt quite a bit, but I only cried out for a few seconds! My Parents were very proud of me for not making a fuss!

The vaccinations via injection were Hib (<a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/hib/en/">Haemophilus influenza type b</a>), PCV (<a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/pneumococcal/en/">Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine</a>), and HB (<a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/hepatitisB/en/">Hepatitis B</a>). The oral dose was the <a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/rotavirus/en/">Rotavirus</a> vaccine.

Together, these diseases I’m now vaccinated against kill millions of people per year. I’m so lucky to now be protected!

Getting vaccinated sure made me tired. I slept nearly the entire day...
