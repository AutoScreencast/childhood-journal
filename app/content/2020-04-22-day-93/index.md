Today, we went to <a href="https://tmsc.jp">Tokyo Medical and Surgical Clinic</a> next to Tokyo Tower, for my 3-month Wellness Checkup. We went to see Dr. Tom Lomax, who is also my Dad’s doctor.

I like Dr. Lomax – he is direct and is able to comment on a wide range of issues.

I weighed in at 6,835 grams, and was measured to be 64.1 cm tall. My chest circumference was 41.3 cm, and my head circumference was 40.9 cm.

My diagnosis was that I am healthy, with minor <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/plagiocephaly-brachycephaly/">plagiocephaly</a>. This is a common issue with babies my age, and is expected to improve naturally as I grow.

Here are some pics of me with Tokyo Tower in the background.
