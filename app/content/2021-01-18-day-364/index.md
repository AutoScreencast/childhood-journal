Last night to this morning, I had my first fever ðŸŒ¡, which reached 38.5Â°C. I had a cough and a runny nose. My fever had subsided by the morning, but my Parents are taking me see a doctor just in case. I wonâ€™t be going to nursery school today.

The doctor said that I have a virus, but it doesnâ€™t seem to be anything serious. If my temperature stays below 37.5Â°C for 24 hours, I can go back to nursery school again. She gave me some medication in case I have a fever again.

After the visit to the doctor, my Parents tried to cheer me up by taking me to the swings in Arisugawa Park in Hiroo.
